Elements in "Black Robe" Borrowed from Frances Parkman and The Jesuit Relations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Algonkians visiting Quebec are amazed at a clock, which they call Captain Clock. | Reactions to clocks, writing, etc. and Jesuit manipulations mentioned (Thwaites VIII: 109). |
| Governor Champlain warns the Jesuit superior of physical & social demands that will be made on Father Laforgue travelling with Indians. | Details in Brebeuf, "Instructions for the Fathers of Our Society Who Shall Be Sent to the Huron" (Thwaities XII: 116-123; Parkman 1867: 142) |
| Champlain has ceremonial meeting with Algonkian, introduces Laforgue and other Jesuits with phrase, "These are our fathers." | Meeting and words "These are our Fathers" in Thwaites V: 251; Parkman 1867: 135-136. |
| Father Laforgue & lay companion set out in autumn from Quebec to Huron territory in 1634, accompanied by a party of Algonkian. | _Three_ parties of priests and hired men set out _in summer_, escorted by _Huron_ (Thwaites VIII: 69-95; Parkman 1867: 135-145; Trigger 1976: 490-494). |
| Laforgue suffers discomfort and culture shock among Algonkian, especially in smoke-filled hut with sleeping Indians and dogs | Details from Lejeune 1634, "What One Must Suffer in Wintering with the Savages." (Thwaites VII: 35-65; Parkman 1867: 114-116) _concerning Montagnais._ |
| Laforgue is plagued by a dwarf Montagnais sorcerer named Mestigoit. | Among Montagnais, Fa. LeJeune plagued by shaman whose _brother_ is named Mestigoit (Thwaites VII: 54-65; Parkman 1867: 108-109, 116). Among Huron, missionaries struggle against dwarf shaman named Tonneraouanont (Thwaites XIII-XIV; Parkman 1867: 180-182; Trigger 1976:529). |
| On the journey, Laforgue uses writing to overawe Algonkian; Indians convinced he is a sorcerer. Europeans criticized for stinginess and covetousness; Laforgue preaches on the afterlife. | Jesuit Relations describe these encounters, mostly as they occurred _at the Hurom mission_ (Thwaites 1896-1901, _passim;_ Parkman 1867: 177-178). |
| Laforgue is abandoned by his Algonkian guides. | Three of French on 1634 voyage abandoned at different moments (Thwaites VIII: 81-85; Parkman I867: 141-143; Trigger 1976: 492). |
| Attack by Iroquois. Laforgue is captured when he comes out of hiding. | Father Isaac Jogues, Jesuit saint, captured by Iroquois when he comes out of hiding (Thwaites XXX1: 16-109; Parkman 1867: 305-334)." |
| At Iroquois village, captives run gauntlet. Laforgue's thumb is cut off with shell. Iroquois debate whether to torture and kill him or trade him back to the French. | Jogues and companions run gauntlet; Jogues's thumb cut off; Jogues subject of debates among Iroquois. |
| Laforgue and companions escape Iroquois. | Jogues escapes down Hudson River, to Europe, back to Quebec and eventual martyrdom. |
| As the Indian leader Chomina dies, he sees a vision of a fearsome female spirit who awaits him in the afterlife. | Parkman (1867: 69-70,72) makes much of a terrifying female spirit mentioned by the Jesuits (Thwaites VI: 75). |
| Just before reaching Huron village, Laforgue is abandoned by last surviving companions | Fa. Brebeuf left by companions just short of his goal in Huronia (Thwaites XXXI: 91; Parkman 1867: 143-144; Trigger 1976: 493). |
| In Huron village, an epidemic rages. Baptism is interpreted by Huron as either cause or cure of illness. | During 1630s in Huron missions, epidemics are blamed on baptism (Thwaites VII, XI,XIII, XIV; Parkman 1867: 204-214, Trigger 1976: 499-602)
